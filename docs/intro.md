## What is Prem?

Prem is a platform for running open-source AI models on your own devices, either on MacOS, useful for local development and personal use or on your Linux servers for production. Prem is open source and free to use, no data is collected because we CANNOT see your data, as everything runs on-premise.

## Get started

- Develop applications with Prem [installing Prem App on MacOS or your own Linux Server for production](/docs/prem-app/install-prem).
