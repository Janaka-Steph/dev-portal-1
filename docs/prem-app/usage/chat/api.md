# APIs

Each service exposes certain APIs. If one of the Prem services is running in your infrastructure, you can check the swagger at `http://{localhost|ip}:{port}/docs`. For what concerns the Chat services, we expose same endpoints as Chat OpenAI Models do with some small differences based on the service that you are running.
